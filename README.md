# Away3D custom

## Changes brought to the original Away release

 * HoverController:
	* We allow immediate changes of position;
 * VideoTexture:
	* We can change the player;
	* We implemented smart updates: only update texture if player's current frame number has changed;
	* We report the actual number of updated frames per second;
 * IVideoPlayer:
	* We can specify the number of frames per second (as we could specify width and height), called fps;
	* We have access to the current frame number;
 * SimpleVideoPlayer:
	* Implementation of new methods specified by IVideoPlayer;
	* We can play videos streamed via RTMP;
	* We now indicate when video is ready to be played (requires that connection to streaming server has been established);
	* Separated NetStream and NetConnection handling from this class and creation of NetStreamsManager.
